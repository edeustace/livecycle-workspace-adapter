# livecycle-workspace-adapter
This is a simple library that simplifies interfacing with an Adobe Livecycle Workspace Server.
## Dependencies
You'll need to add fds.swc, fds.rb.swc and playerfds.swc as dependencies when building this with maven - you can get these in your livecycle installation folder.
I can't provide them here.

## Usage
See the example mxml file. That shows how to get a users tasks after logging in.
